### Introduction
- This project aim to reimplement Darknet architecture and YOLO (v3) object detection algorithm from scratch with pytorch and fastai library
### Todo
- [ ] Read COCO dataset with FastAI DataBunch
- [ ] Create Darknet Architecture with pure Pytorch and Python code
- [ ] Write loss function with pure Pytorch and Python code
- [ ] Train with FastAI api
- [ ] Inferent pictures
- [ ] Inferent with video
- [ ] Real time inference

### Introduction
- This project aim to reimplement [SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) algorithm from scratch with pytorch and fastai library
### Result
![](res.png)
### Todo
- [x] Read [Pascal VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/) with FastAI DataBunch
- [x] Create modified VGG architecture with pure Pytorch and Python code
- [x] Write loss function with pure Pytorch and Python code
- [x] Train with FastAI api
- [x] Inferent pictures
- [x] Non-Max Suppression
- [ ] mAP (mean Average Precision)
- [ ] Inferent with video
- [ ] Real time inference
- [ ] Clean code (Optional)
### Problems
- [x] Slow IOU calculation
- [ ] Slow inference
